Installation Methods
--------------------

> [!TIP]
>
> `your-plugin-name` is the name you want to use for the plugin. The recommended plugin name is `minify`, but you may
> want to use a different name for certain purposes. For example, Kirby does not have a hook priority feature, so the
> order in which hooks are executed depends entirely on the name of the plugin folder. This plugin should ideally be
> executed at the very end, so it is a good idea to give it a folder name that allows it to be positioned at the very
> end of the plugin list.

### Download

Download the plugin via the
[download link](https://github.com/taufik-nurrohman/kirby-minify/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip) and extract. Then put the
extracted folder into the `/site/plugins/` folder of your Kirby project. If the `plugins` folder does not exist yet,
create it first. The resulting folder structure should look like this:

~~~ txt
.\
â””â”€â”€ site\
    â””â”€â”€ plugins\
        â””â”€â”€ your-plugin-name\
            â”œâ”€â”€ index.php
            â””â”€â”€ â€¦
~~~

### Git

If you use Git to version control your project, you can install plugins that are available from an online service like
GitHub as a Git sub-module:

~~~ sh
git submodule add https://github.com/taufik-nurrohman/kirby-minify.git site/plugins/your-plugin-name
~~~

### Composer

This installation method works best if your project is managed via Composer as well. Then you can run the following
command from the root of your project:

~~~ sh
composer require taufik-nurrohman/kirby-minify
~~~
